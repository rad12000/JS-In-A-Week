# Prompt mini-project
The goal here is to write the logic to collect a user's name and age, with some valiation:

1. When the page `start`s, `prompt` the user for their name.
2. `if` they do not provide a name, or they provide a name with a `length` less than 3, `alert` them the valid provided is invalid and ask them for their name again.
3. `if` they enter a value that Is Not A Number (`isNaN()`), `alert` them the valid provided is invalid and ask them for their age again.
4. Use the `displayMessage()` function to output the user's `name` and `age`.
